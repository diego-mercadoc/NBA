You say what's next, to see if all the changes made work, and see how everything works out. The goal is to see if running everything for THE REST OF today's matches (January 19, 2025) works correctly.

FIRST OF ALL: **Choose the most viable most doable thing first if you have already done something, choose the next and so on...**

## 2. More Robust Hyperparameter Tuning

### Why?
- You’re already using decently optimized parameters for your ensemble. But short manual tuning can overlook better parameter settings.

### Suggestions
1. **Bayesian Optimization**  
   - Use libraries like [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) or [hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) to systematically search for optimal hyperparameters.  
   - This is typically more efficient than naive grid search.
2. **Nested Cross-Validation**  
   - Instead of a single train/test split, use cross-validation for both tuning and final evaluation.  
   - Ensures your hyperparameters generalize well to unseen data.

## 3. Weighted Model Ensembling Based on Season Segments

### Why?
- Early-season data differs from mid-season data (teams are still finding chemistry, injuries accumulate, etc.). You’re already weighting entire seasons (1.0 vs. 0.8 vs. 0.6), but you can also adapt your ensemble approach to weigh **time segments** differently.

### Suggestions
1. **Segment the Current Season**  
   - Instead of a uniform weighting across all games in 2025, segment them (e.g., “first 20 games,” “mid-season,” “post-All-Star”).  
   - Train separate sub-models or give sub-weights for each segment.
2. **Use Rolling Windows in Training**  
   - Rather than training on the entire historical dataset equally, put more emphasis on the last X weeks of data for the current season.  
   - “Recency weighting” can help capture teams’ near-term form.

## 4. Calibration and Probability Refinement

### Why?
- Your ensemble produces probabilities (for moneyline, etc.). Even if your raw accuracy is decent, the probability estimates might be miscalibrated. Good calibration is crucial for betting markets and better expected value decisions.

### Suggestions
1. **Reliability Diagrams / Calibration Curves**  
   - Plot predicted probabilities vs. actual outcomes.  
   - If predictions are over/underconfident, apply **Platt scaling** or **Isotonic regression** to refine them.
2. **Brier Score or Log-Loss**  
   - Instead of just measuring accuracy, measure how “off” the probability predictions are. Fine-tune until these scores improve.

## 5. Enhanced Feature Engineering for Spreads and Totals

### Why?
- Spreads and totals are more sensitive to pace, tempo changes, and matchup-specific mismatches.

### Suggestions
1. **Matchup-Specific Stats**  
   - Offensive eFG% vs. Opponent’s interior/exterior defense.  
   - Frequency of 3-pointers vs. Opponent’s 3-point defense.  
   - Offense–defense synergy stats can better predict totals and spreads.
2. **Team Shooting Variance**  
   - Some teams rely on high-variance 3-point shooting.  
   - A “volatility” metric can help refine totals (teams that go wildly under/over).
3. **Player Mismatches**  
   - E.g., a center who thrives against small-ball lineups or a guard who’s unstoppable against certain defensive styles.  
   - Even if you don’t do full player-level modeling, you can approximate mismatch ratings.

## 6. Strengthen Short-Term vs. Long-Term Momentum Indicators

### Why?
- You already have rolling 5-game stats. However, some teams show “hot streak” or “cold streak” patterns that fade quickly.

### Suggestions
1. **Different Window Lengths**  
   - Compare 3-game form vs. 10-game form.  
   - Merge them into your model to see which is more predictive for each outcome.
2. **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)**  
   - Instead of simple average across the last 5 games, weight more recent games more heavily.  
   - This can better capture “hot” or “cold” streaks.

## 7. Simulations or Monte Carlo Approaches

### Why?
- Betting edges can be more reliably identified if you simulate game outcomes (especially for totals/spreads).

### Suggestions
1. **Bootstrap Predictions**  
   - After your regression for spreads/totals, create a distribution of outcomes (e.g., normally distributed around the predicted mean).  
   - Estimate probabilities of covering certain lines or going over/under certain totals.
2. **Synthetic Probability**  
   - For each game, sample from the distribution multiple times, see how often Team A wins, how often total goes over.  
   - Compare to sportsbook lines to identify edges.

## 9. Expand the Value Rating Logic

### Why?
- You already have a “value rating” using factors like probability margin, rest, form factor, etc. You can refine or expand these to better reflect real betting edges.

### Suggestions
1. **Kelly Criterion or Variation**  
   - Integrate the Kelly formula to determine the stake size based on your edge.  
   - This ensures bets with higher edges get bigger allocations.
2. **Line Movement Tracking**  
   - If a line moved significantly from open to current, re-check your bet’s value rating. Some “value” may have disappeared.

## 10. Continuous Model Updating (Rolling Retraining)

### Why?
- Over a long NBA season, teams’ strengths can change drastically. A model trained in October could get stale by March.

### Suggestions
1. **Weekly or Bi-Weekly Retraining**  
   - Incrementally update your dataset with the most recent games, re-train or “warm-start” your ensemble so it adapts to fresh data.
2. **Validation on Rolling Windows**  
   - Validate model performance on the last 2–3 weeks of data. If performance dips, prompt a re-training or parameter re-check.

***Finally, IMPORTANT: 
IMPORTANT: READ EVERYTHING IN THE CODEBASE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING, MINOR CHANGES CAN RUIN ALL THE PROGRESS MADE.
Remember to keep updating @\Users\Diego\Documents\Github\NBA\.cursorrules  and @README.md. Only when satisfied and tested and ran the new changes. And pushing and all the GitHub branching, synching and pushing and committing steps.
TRY NOT TO MESS UP WHAT ALREADY WORKS.***
