Should we include and how?:

1. On/Off Stats: If you need advanced on-court/off-court data, check specialized sources like PBPStats.com or FantasyLabs.
2. Betting Data: If you plan to compare model predictions with betting lines, incorporate odds from an odds-aggregator (e.g., OddsPortal) or an API.

i WANT MORE CONFIDENCE. ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK OF AS AN EXPERT.

***Finally, IMPORTANT: 
Remember to keep updating @\Users\Diego\Documents\Github\NBA\.cursorrules  and @README.md. Only when satisfied and tested and ran the new changes. And pushing and all the GitHub branching, synching and pushing and committing steps.
TRY NOT TO MESS UP WHAT ALREADY WORKS.***
