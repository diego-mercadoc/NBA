Continue, with your progress. NOTE:  drop whatever it's causing us problem, for the sake of everything else to work. To predict.

***Finally, IMPORTANT: 
IMPORTANT: READ EVERYTHING IN THE CODEBASE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING, MINOR CHANGES CAN RUIN ALL THE PROGRESS MADE.
Remember to keep updating @\Users\Diego\Documents\Github\NBA\.cursorrules  and @README.md. Only when satisfied and tested and ran the new changes. And pushing and all the GitHub branching, synching and pushing and committing steps.
TRY NOT TO MESS UP WHAT ALREADY WORKS.***
