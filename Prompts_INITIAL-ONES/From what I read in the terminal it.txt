From what I read in the terminal it confused me. For example, i said "October 2025" but the current "2024-25 NBA Schedule and Results" starts from "October 2024" all the way to "June 2025", (considering today is "2025-01-18"/ January 18, 2025; and that the available scheduled matches from NBA are until "April 13, 2025" so we'll have to wait for the next availabe scheduled matches). Also, shorten the cooling down time a lot. 

***I can see that there are only available from "December to July" pages, from "2021": "@https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_games.html" and I can see that in "2022" there is data from "October to June" and that trend keeps on up until today "2025-01-18".  Take in count the years and season dates. because for example: 1. This link "@https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_games.html " has this title "2020-21 NBA Schedule and Results" 2. This link "@https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_games.html" has this title "2021-22 NBA Schedule and Results" 3. This link "@https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_games.html " has this title "2022-23 NBA Schedule and Results" and so on. The exceptions occured during covid season and years. Finally, you've got to consider that the current season (today being "2025-01-18") has only played from "october 2024" to today "2025-01-18". And has already "scheduled but not played" the games from today "2025-01-18" up until "April 2025", 2025-04-13" and we're obviously missing the ones that aren't already scheduled for the rest of "2025 April and up until 2025 June", but when we update our data later, we'll fetch them, we'll make our predictions with ML, by matchdays, because we'll use it for betting several statistics and creating parlays that have bets that don't overlap so they can be put in the same parlay (betting houses rules).
